## Gameplay Overview
<br />

**Rules** <br />
> [!NOTE]
> _Java Checkers functions like normal checkers with one restriction:_ <br />
> _A piece can only jump over one opposing piece each turn._ 

> Black moves first.

> Each player takes turns moving one of their pieces. <br />
> A normal piece can be moved diagonally forward.

> A player may move a piece two spaces forward by jumping over an opposing piece. <br />
> If a piece has been jumped over, it is removed from play.

> If a piece reaches the far side of the board, it is kinged. <br />
> Kinged pieces can move diagonally in any direction.

> The game ends when a player has no pieces left.
<br />
